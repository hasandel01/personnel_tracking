# Employee Tracking Mechanism using ESP32 and PlatformIO

This project aims to build a tracking mechanism based on beacons for monitoring the location of employees. The system utilizes ESP32 microcontrollers and PlatformIO as the development platform.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of employees using beacons
- Accurate location detection within the premises
- Customizable settings for tracking intervals and beacon configurations
- Data storage and analysis for tracking history

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- ESP32 microcontrollers
- Beacons compatible with ESP32
- PlatformIO installed on your development machine

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to your computer.
3. Open the project in PlatformIO.
4. Build and upload the code to the ESP32.

## Usage

1. Configure the beacon settings in the code according to your requirements.
2. Power on the ESP32 and deploy the beacons in the desired locations.
3. The ESP32 will start tracking the employees' locations and store the data.
4. Access the stored data for analysis and monitoring.
